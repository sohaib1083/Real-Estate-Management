# Real Estate Management MERN Project

This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) project for managing real estate properties.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main folders:
- `api`: Contains the backend server built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- `client`: Contains the frontend React.js application.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and running locally or accessible remotely.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-estate-management.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd real-estate-management
```

3. Install dependencies for both the API and client:

```bash
cd api
npm install
cd ../client
npm install
```

### Starting the Development Server

1. Start the backend API server:

```bash
cd api
npm run dev
```

The API server will start running at `http://localhost:5000`.

2. Start the frontend React.js application:

```bash
cd ../client
npm start
```

The React development server will start running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

Once both the API server and frontend application are running, you can access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`. From there, you can interact with the real estate management system to view, add, update, and delete properties.
